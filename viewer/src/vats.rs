//! V.A.T.S. in the viewer, run as the game runs it. The rules are
//! `world::vats` (chances, costs, the queue), the menu's view and the camera
//! shots `world::vats_camera`, the menu itself `ui::vats` (drawn by `hud`
//! over the HUD); findings in `%USERPROFILE%\nv-re\findings\vats.md` and
//! `vats_camera_menu.md`.
//!
//! - V opens it (`00942800`, `007e9200`) on the target V.A.T.S. picks
//!   first; the others are listed by their bearing from the player
//!   (`007f0500`). The game's world stops while its menu is up (MenuMode:
//!   the main loop `0086e650` skips the clock, actors and physics): Bevy's
//!   virtual clock is paused, and the menu, its animations and its camera
//!   run on real time.
//! - Mode 1 while V is held after opening, 2 once it's let go, 3 while the
//!   target is scanned; V pressed again goes back to 1 (`007ec810`). The
//!   player is turned toward the target and the view zoomed on it, eased
//!   (`world::vats_camera::MenuView`); the part labels wait for both.
//! - Keys as the PC game binds them: A / D the previous / next target
//!   (`UIVATSSelectTarget`, or `UIVATSEnterFail` with only one), W / S the
//!   next / previous part whose label shows (`UIVATSSelectTargetPart`), the
//!   left button queues an attack on the part (`UIVATSMove`), B or the right
//!   button takes the last one back (`UIMenuCancel`; with nothing queued it
//!   leaves), R / F the special attacks, E plays the queue (`UIVATSExit`,
//!   `UIVATSReady`; with nothing queued it leaves).
//! - Playback (`009c7240`, `world::vats_camera::Playback`): each attack
//!   picks its camera path (`CPTH`, its conditions asked about the player
//!   and the target) and plays its shots (`CAMS`): the world at the shot's
//!   multiplier, the player and the target at theirs (every vanilla player
//!   attack gets `SimpleFrontHit01`: the world at ¼, the player × 4, the
//!   target × 3, from the moment the shot lands); the camera at the shot's
//!   animated model (`meshes\vatscameras\*.nif`) on its node, turned by the
//!   heading, looking at the target with the model's own angles laid on,
//!   its field of view keyed; the shot's image space modifier on. The
//!   camera is kept out of walls as the game's chase camera is
//!   (`0094a0c0`, `world::vats_camera::ChaseDistance`): a sphere
//!   `fCameraCasterSize` wide cast through the cell's collision from the
//!   shot's node toward where the model wants the camera. Before a shot
//!   starts the player's own view, turned at the part (`009445b0` mode
//!   4). Then `fVATSPlaybackDelay` of the world's time, and off.
//! - Each attack's camera path conditions can ask the smart camera checks
//!   (`GetVATS<Side>AreaFree`, `…TargetVisible`): lines cast here as
//!   `008bd830` / `008bdbd0` cast them, the rules in `world::vats`.
//! - A gun reloads itself in playback when its clip runs out, as it does
//!   with the attack control held; the menu charges the reload on the
//!   attack that empties the clip and lists "Reload" after it.
//! - The menu is open to the scripts as `MenuMode 1056`.
//! - Action points are taken as each attack is done; they come back only
//!   once V.A.T.S. is off.
//!
//! Not the game's (each also in the project notes): the scan's part
//! visibility (the game counts pixels with occlusion queries; here the
//! share of points along a part's capsules a line from the eye reaches),
//! read two frames after the target comes up; shots are hitscan (the
//! game's fly as missiles in V.A.T.S.), so a shot's projectile is there for
//! the frame it's fired and gone the next; the attack's shots spaced by the
//! weapon's fire rate in the player's time (the game's attack animation
//! fires them); a melee blow lands as it's swung; the target's
//! multiplier speeds its animations only (its movement and AI timers run
//! at the world's); bounds from `OBND` (`vats_camera::bound_sphere`); the
//! third-person view the game keeps between shots isn't drawn (no player
//! body): the player's view shows there. Not done: the scan highlight, the
//! per-target light, mouse picking and edge panning, the damage preview,
//! quaternion-keyed cameras' turns, the attacker's bone
//! for shots that follow it (such shots aren't placed), Mysterious
//! Stranger and Miss Fortune, the kill camera's own paths, image space
//! cross-fades, grenades and thrown weapons, objects as targets.
